# EarthWalkSoftware/alpine-registry-ssl

*docker-registry-ssl* creates a temporary Alpine Linux container, based upon *nimmis/alpine-micro*, that implements an interactive console-based ssl certificate generator for use with *docker registry* using *openssl*.  The generated certificates are stored in a user-specified folder, and the ca.crt certificate is stored in the required docker folder.
